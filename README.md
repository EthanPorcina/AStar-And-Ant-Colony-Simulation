# AStar-And-Ant-Colony-Simulation
This is two games. One is the implementation of the A* algorithm on different terrain types. Terrain is fully customizable. The second is a simulation of an ant colony. Ants must get food, return it to the colony to birth new ants. Once food is delivered, they become thirsty and must find a source of water. Poison kills ants.
